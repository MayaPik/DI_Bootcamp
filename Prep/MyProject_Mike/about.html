                    <p>Personality
                        In Monsters, Inc. Mike and Sulley are at each other's throats sometimes; however, it is usually Mike who gets annoyed by Sulley first. He is funny, smart, brave, but can sometimes fail to see the obvious in a situation. He's also a very caring and dedicated friend, never going through with abandoning Sulley, no matter what.
                        
                        Early in the movie, Mike had a huge disdain for Boo, as he sees her as both a threat and a detriment to their careers. However, as the movie progresses, Mike starts to genuinely bond with Boo to the point of defending her as not dangerous to Mr. Waternoose after Sulley accidentally scared her. This development in his personality is fully shown by the time the same child-in-the-monster-world antic happened again with Snore, as not only he bonded with the baby, he also did so to prevent having to let Sulley to go through another heartbreak of separating with another person he bonded with as he's still heartbroken of parting with Boo.
                        
                        In Monsters University, Mike was vaguely the same but, due to his youth, he had richer determination and planned to become a Scarer in MU's prestigious Scaring Program. As a child, he'd been overlooked for being smaller than everyone but was inspired by Scarer Frank McCay to become one himself. With hard work and studying, he was accepted into MU and confidently strove to succeed.
                        
                        However, his determination to prove he had what it takes led him to join the Oozma Kappa fraternity as a last-minute resort to enter the Scare Games. But because Mike cared more about his goals than the fraternity, his recklessness and lack of cooperation almost cost them losing the first round of the Scare Games, and it was only because Jaws Theta Chi's cheating by using illegal protective gel, they were permitted to stay in the Games. After his team's humiliation by the hands of Roar Omega Roar and seeing his team losing their spirit, Mike took them to Monsters Inc. to inspire them and started training them, showing immense skill and potential in coaching. With Mike's hard work, the team progressed through the rounds; Mike also became appreciative of his team.
                        
                        Unfortunately, Mike's shame of not being scary came back to affect him following the games' conclusion, where, determined to prove everyone wrong, Mike stole a key into the door lab and entered the human world to scare a child, only to realize the hard way, that Sulley had been right when the children aren't scared of him at all.
                        
                        When Sulley comes through to find him, Mike expresses his sadness, stating he thought if wanted it enough he could prove he was something special and accused Sulley of not understanding him whereupon Sulley admitted his faults and, to Mike's shock, Sulley admitted he acted scary because he was terrified of the expectations he would have to live up to.
                        
                        As Sulley pointed out, Mike's greatest strength is his fearlessness, despite not being scary himself. So much that even Dean Hardscrabble was impressed by Mike's hard work, and had encouraged them, particularly Mike, to keep surprising others and wishing them luck. Thanks to his perseverance, Mike was able to get him and Sulley their dream of being a Scare Team after a period of hard work.</p>

                        <h2 id="newcar">Mike's New Car</h2>
                        <p>In the short, Mike is now the main character of his own story. He has brought a new six-wheel drive car, and wants to show it to Sulley. When they both get in the car, Sulley accidentally ruins the brand-new car and injures Mike. In the end, Mike kicks Sulley out, speeds off and wrecks the car completely.

                        <h2 id="partycentral">Party Central</h2>
                        <p>In the short film Party Central Mike shows up at Oozma Kaapa's party when Sully and Mike decides to visit them. Mike then uses a borrowed door to get monsters from the Roar Omega Roar party to show up at the party at Oozma Kappa. When the party is over, Mike is last seen leaving the house.

                        <p>Mike and Sully are now in charge of Monster Inc. after Waternoose's arrest. He works as a Jokester and trains former scarers to be Jokesters. It is shown he has a brother, too. He enters a bowling competition against him, and they are shown to be rivals.

                        <h2 id="monstersinc">Monsters, Inc.
                        </h2>
                        <p>In the first film, Mike is the best friend, roommate, personal trainer, and assistant to Sulley, the top scarer at Monsters, Inc. They both share a rivalry with Randall Boggs. He is Celia Mae's boyfriend and Roz is frequently annoyed by his inability to turn in his paperwork on time. While at Harryhausen's for Celia's birthday, Sulley interrupted the date to inform Mike that he had lead a human girl into the monster world. Putting her into a Monsters, Inc. gym bag, Sulley tried to show him, but Boo escaped the bag and wreaked havoc all over the restaurant. The two snuck her out before the CDA could catch her and disinfected the entire restaurant.

                          When Mr. Waternoose throws Sulley and Mike into the frozen wasteland, a rift forms between them after Mike becomes furious at him for listening to Waternoose instead of him.
                          
                          When they learn that Waternoose and Randall are secretly plotting to drain children of screams, Sulley tricks Mr. Waternoose into confessing his complicity with Randall's scheme while Mike records the confession and smugly replays it to watching CDA agents. Immediately, the CDA arrest Mr. Waternoose for his crimes. Roz ordered the shredding of Boo's door, but Mike rebuilds it after Sullivan becomes CEO of Monster's Inc.
                          
                          Sometime after the film, Mike produces the low-budget company play "Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me."
